## Week 7

Make sure that you've gone through [items 1 and 2 from last week](./week-6/README.md) using Visual Studio and understand GET vs. POST and debugging in Visual Studio.  Please read the following two PDFs:

### Reading Material
1. [Database Basics 1](./SQL-Chapter-3.pdf)

2. [Database Basics 2](./SQL-Chapter-3-Pt2.pdf)

### Assigment
1. [Download SQL Server Express] (http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sqlserver/editions/2012-editions/express.aspx)  First install "SQL Server Express (Containing only the database engine)" and then istall "SQL Server Management Studio (Tools Only)."

2. Create a database and some tables that model a DVD lending system using SQL Server Express.  So the idea is that you have a collection of DVDs and that you have some friends who like borrowing them.  Since you don't like giving away your DVDs,  you want to create a simple database to track which friends borrowed which DVDs.  The details are up to you to implement, but the result should be that you know which friends borrowed which DVDs on which calendar day.

3. Be prepared to share your database design with your peers next week.
